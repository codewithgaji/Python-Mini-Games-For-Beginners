# Python Mini Games for Beginners 🎮

This repository is a collection of simple yet engaging mini games, perfect for Python beginners looking to sharpen their skills and explore the **`random` library**. Each game provides a great opportunity to practice coding concepts, understand randomness, and think about ways to enhance the base code.

## **Overview of the Games**

1. **Dice Rolling Game** 🎲  
   A simple game where the user rolls a virtual dice, and the outcome (a number between 1 and 6) is randomly generated.  
   **Enhancement Ideas**: 
   - Allow users to roll multiple dice at once.  
   - Add a scoring system.  

2. **Coin Toss Game** 🪙  
   Simulates flipping a coin and outputs whether it landed on "Heads" or "Tails".  
   **Enhancement Ideas**:  
   - Track how many times each side appears in a session.  
   - Add an option for the user to guess the result before flipping.  

3. **Number Guessing Game** 🔢  
   The computer randomly selects a number, and the user has to guess it. After each guess, the program provides feedback (e.g., "Too high" or "Too low").  
   **Enhancement Ideas**:  
   - Add difficulty levels with different number ranges.  
   - Implement a scoring system based on the number of attempts.
  
4. **Rock, Paper, Scissors** ✂️  
   A fun game where the user competes against the computer by choosing "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors".  
   **Enhancement Ideas**:  
   - Add a best-of-three or best-of-five feature.  
   - Include more options, such as "Lizard" and "Spock" (from "The Big Bang Theory" version).
